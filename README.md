# defconbot
This was a university group project written by myself one other student.

It was submitted as part of the University of Liverpool Master's Degree in Web Science and Big Data in the module about Object Oriented Programming in Java.

The primary objective of the assignment was to demonstrate the use of OO techniques. The subject we chose was a simple chatbot answering questions about the speaker, location and time of sessions at a recent DefCon.

Myself and the other student divided development tasks and both contributed equally to the final code. We did not finish the chatbot as such but the submission was sufficient for us to pass the module with a reasonable grade.
