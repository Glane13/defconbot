# defconbot
This was a university group project written by myself one other student.

It was submitted as part of the University of Liverpool Master's Degree in Web Science and Big Data in the module about Object Oriented Programming in Java.

The primary objective of the assignment was to demonstrate the use of OO techniques. The subject we chose was a simple chatbot answering questions about the speaker, location and time of sessions at a recent DefCon.

Myself and the other student divided development tasks and both contributed equally to the final code. We choose to use GitHub for our source code in order to practice standard development techniques even though this was not strictly part of the University assignment. 

We did not finish the chatbot as such but the submission was sufficient for us to demonstrate our use of OOP and to pass the module with a reasonable grade.
